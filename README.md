# Go and Chat

Initial attempt at writing a client/server CLI chat program in GO.

This repo will build both the server and client binaries.

## Installation
#### From source (assuming you have Go installed and on your PATH, and you have GOPATH set up)
1. 'go get' the client ```go get github.com/michael-robbins/go-and-chat/cmd/gochat-client```

2. That will install the client binary into $GOPATH/bin/gochat-client(.exe)

3. 'go get' the server ```go get github.com/michael-robbins/go-and-chat/cmd/gochat-server```

4. That will install the server binary into $GOPATH/bin/gochat-server(.exe)

5. (Optionally) copy the client (and optionally the server) into a local execution path (Eg. /usr/local/bin/)
